                <p>
                    Hello and welcome to one of the first websites of my own design, what you see now likely will not be
                    what you see several weeks from now as i hope to make this a continual project upon which i can
                    improve. I am very new to the coding world and am very excited that i finally decided to take a
                    chance and invest in myself so that i can make a better future for me and my wife. While the pages
                    layout speaks for itself, what kind of host would i be if i didnt give you a tour? if you click <a
                        href="#coding">here</a> you will be taken to my current and previous projects i have worked on,
                    it may not be much now but we all start somewhere. Next you will find a small<a href="#photos">
                        collection</a> of some of my favorite photos that i have taken as well as a link to a page
                    dedicated to all my photos and pricing on serices offered. Lastly, but likely most importantly, you
                    will find a section at the bottom of the page titled <a href="#interests">Work Interests.</a> While
                    the name speaks for itself, you may ask yourself why i decided to put what is arguably the most
                    important information at the bottom as opposed to the top and the answer is simple. <br />
                    If i was to show you my full resume, you would see i have worked in almost every industry, from
                    healthcare to retail to customer service and even the military. And the biggest lesson that i have
                    learned from working in so many different enviroments and with so many tyes of people, is that the
                    people you work with can and always will be the deciding factor in wether or not you will find
                    meaning and happiness in not just your workplace but also your personal life. And so while this page
                    is meant to serve as a reference into my proffessional abilities, i hope it also serves as a guide
                    to who i am as a person.</p>

            <h4>Marketing and SEO management</h4>
            <p>In todays ever changing market it can be hard for small business onwners to not only draw in new business
                but also retain them. Some times it's due to poor location, staff or services. But many times it is also
                due to a lack of exposure to your target audience, And this is where i hope to help small and large
                businesses alike. Wether it is designing and building a more streamlined and accessible website, to
                increasing overall traffick and attention on the web through a increased social media presence, i would
                love to have the opportunity to sit down with individuals and assess their unique and individual needs
                and come up with a pan of action to help increase their chances at success. </p>

            <h4>Game design</h4>
            <p>I wear the badge of a gaming nerd proudly and without shame. growing up i remember long nights spent
                playing vanilla world of war-craft, going on hours long raids just to sometimes fail and absolutely
                loving every second of it. While i have neither the time or energy for that anymore, i still have the
                same love for gaming, and while im sure the actual countles hours of coding and preparing games and
                projects like that was no where near as fun or exciting, i think it would be amamzing to be part of a
                team that creates something that people everywhere can turn to for a few hours when they just need a
                break from the world and just get lost in the one you made for them. </p>
